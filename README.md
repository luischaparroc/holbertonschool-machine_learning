# Machine Learning

Module of **Machine Learning** , carried out during **Software Engineering studies** at **[Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)**.

## Technologies
* Scripts are written with Python 3.5
* `NumPy`, version 1.15
* `SciPy`, version 1.3
* `Matplotlib`, version 3.0

## Projects
All of the following folders are projects done during the studies:

| Project name | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| `math/0x00-linear_algebra` | It aims to learn about vectors, matrices, transposes, dot product, matriz multiplication and NumPy |
| `math/0x01-plotting` | It aims to learn about plot, scatter plot, line graph, bar graph, histogram and `matplotlib` |
| `math/0x02-calculus` | It aims to learn about summation and product notation, series, derivative, chain rule, partial derivative and integrals. |
| `math/0x03-probability` | It aims to learn about probability, independence, union, intersection, probability distributions (PDF & PMF), cumulative distribution function, percentile, mean, standard deviation and variance. |
| `supervised_learning/0x00-binary_classification` | It aims to learn about models, supervised learning, prediction, nodes, weight, bias, activation functions, layers, logistic regression, loss and cost functions. |
