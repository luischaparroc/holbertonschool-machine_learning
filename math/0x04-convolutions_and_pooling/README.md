# Probability

Project done during **Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about convolution, max pooling, average pooling, kernel/filter, padding ("same" & "padding"), stride and channels.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.5

## Files
The following files are scripts written in Python:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-convolve_grayscale_valid.py` | Function `convolve_grayscale_valid` that performs a valid convolution on grayscale images |
| `1-convolve_grayscale_same.py` | Function `convolve_grayscale_same` that performs a same convolution on grayscale images |
| `2-convolve_grayscale_padding.py` | Function `convolve_grayscale_padding` that performs a same convolution on grayscale images with custom padding |
| `3-convolve_grayscale.py` | Function `convolve_grayscale` that performs a convolution on grayscale images |
| `4-convolve_channels.py` | Function `convolve_channels` that performs a convolution on images with channels |
| `5-convolve.py` | Function `convolve` that performs a convolution on images using multiple kernels |
| `6-pool.py` | Function `pool` that performs pooling on images |
