# Linear Algebra

Project done during **Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about vectors, matrices, transposes, dot product, matriz multiplication and NumPy.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.5
* `NumPy`, version 1.15
* `SciPy`, version 1.3

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in Python:

| Filename | Description |
