# Keras

Project done during **Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to understand about skip connection, bottleneck layer, Inception Network, ResNet, ResNeXt and DenseNet.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.5
* `Tensorflow`, version 1.12
* `NumPy`, version 1.15
