# Error Analysis

Project done during **Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about confusion matrix, type errors, sensitivity.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.5
* `Tensorflow`, version 1.12
* `NumPy`, version 1.15

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in Python:
