# Error Analysis

Project done during **Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about confusion matrix, type errors, sensitivity.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.5
* `Tensorflow`, version 1.12
* `NumPy`, version 1.15

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in Python:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-create_confusion.py` | Function `create_confusion_matrix` that creates a confusion matrix |
| `1-sensitivity.py` | Function `sensitivity` that calculates the sensitivity for each class in a confusion matrix |
| `2-precision.py` | Function `precision` that calculates the precision for each class in a confusion matrix |
| `3-specificity.py` | Function `specificity` that calculates the specificity for each class in a confusion matrix |
