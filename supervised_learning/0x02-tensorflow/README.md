# Tensorflow

Project done during **Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn graphs, sessions, tensors, placeholders, operations, namespaces, training and checkpoints on Tensorflow

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.5
* `Tensorflow`, version 1.12

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in Python:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-create_placeholders.py` | Function that returns two placeholders, `x` and `y` for the neural network |
| `1-create_layer.py` | Function that creates a layer with a given activation function and input, and returns the output of a layer |
| `2-forward_prop.py` | Function that creates the forward propagation graph for the neural network |
| `3-calculate_accuracy.py` | Function that calculates the accuracy of a prediction |
