# Multiclass Classification

Project done during **Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about multiclass classification, one-hot vector, softmax function, cross-entropy loss and pickling.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.5
* `NumPy`, version 1.15

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in Python:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-one_hot_encode.py` | Function that converts a numeric label vector into a one-hot matrix |
| `1-one_hot_decode.py` | Function that converts a one-hot matrix into a vector of labels |
| `2-deep_neural_network.py` | Functions that saves and loads the DeepNeuralNetwork represented as a file with `pickle` format |
| `3-deep_neural_network.py` | Class `DeepNeuralNetwork` that performs multiclass classification |
| `4-deep_neural_network.py` | Class `DeepNeuralNetwork` that performs multiclass classification with sigmoid and tanh activation function |
