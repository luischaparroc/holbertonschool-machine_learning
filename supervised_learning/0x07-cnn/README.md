# Keras

Project done during **Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about convolution layer, pooling layer, forward propagation and back propagation with CNNs.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.5
* `Tensorflow`, version 1.12
* `NumPy`, version 1.15

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in Python:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-conv_forward.py` | Function `conv_forward` that performs forward propagation over a convolutional layer of a neural network |
| `1-pool_forward.py` | Function `pool_forward` that performs forward propagation over a pooling layer of a neural network |
