# Binary Classification

Project done during **Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about models, supervised learning, prediction, nodes, weight, bias, activation functions, layers, logistic regression, loss and cost functions.

## Technologies
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.5
* `NumPy`, version 1.15
* `Matplotlib`, version 3.0
