# Binary Classigication

Project done during **Software Engineering studies** at **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about models, supervised learning, prediction, nodes, weight, bias, activation functions, layers, logistic regression, loss and cost functions.

## Technologies

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in Python:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-neuron.py` | Class `Neuron` that defines a single neuron performing binary classification |
| `1-neuron.py` | Class `Neuron` with private instance attributes (W, b, A) |
| `2-neuron.py` | Class `Neuron` with `forward_prop` method to calculate the forward propagation of the neuron |
| `3-neuron.py` | Class `Neuron` with `cost` method to calculate the cost of the model using logistic regression |
| `4-neuron.py` | Class `Neuron` with `evaluate` method which returns the neuron's predictions |
| `5-neuron.py` | Class `Neuron` with `gradient_descent` method to calculates one pass of gradient descent on the neuron |
| `6-neuron.py` | Class `Neuron` with `train` method to trains a neuron with logistic regression |
| `7-neuron.py` | Class `Neuron` with `train` method to trains a neuron and graphs its training cost |
